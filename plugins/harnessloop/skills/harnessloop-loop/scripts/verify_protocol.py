"""Verify the mechanical subset of the Harnessloop protocol.

Judgment gates (does this evidence support acceptance?) stay with the model.
This script enforces only machine-checkable rules:

- Rule A (scope-lock containment): every file under a round's evidence/ and
  reviews/ directories must fall inside a path allowed by that round's
  scope-lock.md "Allowed Changes" section.
- Rule B (citation existence): every backtick-quoted span in a round's
  review files that looks like a project-relative path must exist in the
  project. A span is exempt from this check (not treated as a citation) if
  any of the following hold:
    - it contains a regex/glob metacharacter (^ $ * ? | ( ) [ ] { } \\ +),
      e.g. a quoted pattern like `^_?\\s*(no|none)\\b` or a shell glob like
      `__pycache__/*.pyc` — these are not literal paths;
    - it opens with a bare (schemeless) domain followed by a path, e.g.
      `docs.python.org/3/library/os.html` or `github.com/org/repo` — full
      `scheme://` URLs were already exempt, this extends that to the bare
      form reviewers commonly write when citing external docs;
    - it contains an angle-bracket placeholder anywhere, e.g.
      `goals/<id>/data-contract.md` — this describes the *shape* of a path
      template, not a literal reference;
    - the citation's line, or the line immediately before it, carries an
      explicit `<!-- verify:ignore -->` HTML comment — use this to mark a
      review line whose citation is known-intentional prose (e.g. quoting
      another document's typo verbatim) rather than a real reference. This
      is the escape hatch for cases the heuristics above cannot resolve
      mechanically; it does not require a project-level opt-out.

  Existence is checked against the project root, the round's goal
  directory, the round directory itself, the project's own `.harnessloop/`
  directory (so a citation using one of the PATHISH_PREFIXES verbatim,
  e.g. `setup/data-sources.md` or `state/self-check.md`, resolves against
  where those directories actually live), and the root of every
  first-level git submodule declared in the project's .gitmodules (so a
  citation written relative to a submodule's own root, e.g. `plugins/foo/`
  when `foo` is checked out as a submodule at <project>/foo, resolves
  correctly instead of being flagged as dangling).

Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = violations found, 2 = usage error.
